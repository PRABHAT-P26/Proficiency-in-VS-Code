# Proficiency-in-VS-Code
This repository contains code for performing a variety of data analysis tasks and statistical tests on datasets. The project covers techniques for finding unique and duplicate value counts, and analyzing normal distribution. It also includes implementations of Naive Bayes, confusion matrix, and K-fold cross-validation for classification tasks. Additionally, the repository provides analyses for parametric tests such as Z-test, T-test, and ANOVA. It further explores regression models, including Logistic and Linear Regression algorithms. The project also demonstrates the use of Weka, an AI tool, and offers methods for data analysis using correlation and confusion matrices. Each script is designed to help with a comprehensive understanding of the respective statistical and machine learning techniques.
